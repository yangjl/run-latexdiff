Description: 
        #run-latexdiff
        
        A command line tool to create `latexdiff` pdf's for different git commits. Modified from [scm-latexdiff](https://bitbucket.org/paulhiemstra/scm-latexdiff/overview). All credits go to **scm-latexdiff**.
        
        ## INSTALL
        This tool uses **distutils** for installation. The following command installs the tool on your machine:
        ```
        python setup.py install
        ```
        To install to a non-standard directory tree (e.g. in your home directory) use **--prefix**:
        ```
        python setup.py install --prefix=/home/spam/
        ```
        Do remember to add **/home/spam/lib/python2.x/site-packages/** to your 
        **PYTHONPATH** environment variable.
        
        ------------
          
        ## USAGE:
        ```
        ### find help
        run-latexdiff --help (or -h)
        ### running example
        run-latexdiff --old OLD:FILE --new NEW:FILE --diff diff.tex
        run-latexdiff -o f126:ms/old.tex -n jafo12:ms/new.tex -d ms/diff.tex
        ```  
        ### where:
        - OLD:    old revision id, **local** for non-commited
        - NEW:    new revision id, **local** for non-commited
        - FILE:   filename of the file you want to compare
        
        ------------
        
        ## Notes
        
        - Must run in the directory with **.git** file.
        - When referring to a git revision, not the whole sha1 key is needed, you can just provide the first few numbers.
        - Multiple tex file may supported but not tested.
        - If the tex and its associated file in the subdirectory, just run `pdflatex` manually to generate the pdf file.
